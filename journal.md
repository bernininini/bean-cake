- Researched small spy robots and similar IoT projects
- Identified hardware components needed

Prisca: 3.5 hr

### 🗓️ May 18
- Created a rough draft layout of hardware placement
  *did it on paper so, ill be uploading a pic laeter...(still cant find it....oops 👉👈)

- Researched how to stream ESP32-CAM footage to an external display (TFT)
  *we didnt really have pics on that

Bernice: 1.5 hr

### 🗓️ May 20
- Write up sample code for video streaming and motor control
  *with the wiring we had on May18, we tried to write same sample on simulators but the simulators did not have the component we need. And did also does not support wifi.
- Finalized list of hardware and component
  *we both found out that some of the component we wanted to use does not work well with the esp32-s3 and we needed to swap them out and find replacement.

### 🗓️ May 21
- Wrote working code for both the bot (ESP32-S3 CAM) and controller (ESP32 + joystick + TFT)

### 🗓️ June 7/9
- Completing the schematics of both the remote and robot
- Realize that the power source that we were using could cause safty issue so we re did a lot of sourse listing because switch of power sourses. 
- Because the first version did not consider the toggle switch and also forgot the switch button on the joystick
- Updating the BOM
