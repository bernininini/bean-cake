### 🗓️ June 7/9
- Completing the schematics of both the remote and robot
- Realize that the power source that we were using could cause safty issue so we re did a lot of sourse listing because switch of power sourses. 
- Because the first version did not consider the toggle switch and also forgot the switch button on the joystick
- Updating the BOM

### 🗓️ August 3
- Re-cadded the design of the bot to a minecraft cake as it would be easier for it to hide in plain sight
  - Added four N20 motors and designed own wheels
  - Wheels are placed inside the box and as low as possible such that the cake is as inconspicuous as possible
  - Secret button switch cadded
- Bought new ESP32 camera as our old one broke
- Coded new ESP32 camera
