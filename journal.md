🗓️ May 17
- Brainstormed core idea and purpose of the bot
- Researched small spy robots and similar IoT projects
- Identified hardware components needed
- Wrote initial sample code for communication

Prisca: 3.5 hr  
Bernice: 3 hr

🗓️ May 18
- Created a rough draft layout of hardware placement
  *did it on paper so, ill be uploading a pic laeter...(pic#1)

Prisca: 2 hr  
Bernice: 2 hr

🗓️ May 19
- Researched how to stream ESP32-CAM footage to an external display (TFT)
  *we didnt really have pics on that

Bernice: 1.5 hr

🗓️ May 20
- Write up sample code for video streaming and motor control
  *with the wiring we had on May18, we tried to write same sample on simulators but the simulators did not have the component we need. And did also does not support wifi.
- Finalized list of hardware and component
  *we both found out that some of the component we wanted to use does not work well with the esp32-s3 and we needed to swap them out and find replacement.

Prisca: 2 hr  
Bernice: 3 hr

🗓️ May 21
- Wrote working code for both the bot (ESP32-S3 CAM) and controller (ESP32 + joystick + TFT)
  *according the online sample code and reference, we tried to write code the bot and remote again. Hope it works when we have the part.
